![click here](https://github.com/evve212233/Game-Projects/blob/master/Escape%20From%20Earth/Untitled.png)
**You are an alien who got stuck at Earth and try to go back to the space. Itâ€™s your mission to ascend each level without crashing nor running out of fuel in order to reach the surface**
* Each level, the goal is to travel from launch pad to a landing pad .
* Press **SPACE** for fuel engine (go up) .
* Press **A/D** to control the direction .
* Avoid to hit on any **OBSTACLE** (Anything that is not a landing pad or launch pad) while traveling.
* Make sure to have the sound on when you play, it helps to survive in the game and is more fun.

## Upcoming RPG game: Apocalypse Zone
* There will be combat, monster (design, animation, and etc), level design... created all by me.
